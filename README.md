# City & Unit Scaling
Scaling of Cities & Units

## Notes

I saw some people are not happy with how big the units are displayed on the map and that cities are now smaller (they want to see their beautiful cities ^^) compared to earlier releases.

If you want bigger/smaller cities/units, let me know. Changing the default scaling for resources and improvements sometimes changes the 3d sprite into a weird looking 2d sprite, which looks ugly. 


## Installation and use

1. [Download](https://github.com/ShadowDuke/OW_City-Unit-Scaling/archive/master.zip) the files and put the **"Mods"** directory in \Users\\###\Documents\My Games\OldWorld\ or \Users\\###\Documents\My Games\OldWorld\Test\ (if you use the test branch).
   - Help: Windows Explorer; click on Documents; navigate to \My Games\Old World\
2. Go to "Mods" in the main menu and enable "City & Unit Scaling", click "Save" then click "Play with Mods" or set up a new game and go to Advanced Setup to find the mod at the bottom and enable it.
3. Start a new game
