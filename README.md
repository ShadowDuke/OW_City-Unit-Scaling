- Scales units down to 70% of their base scale value
   
- Icons (like food, wood, etc.) are 25% bigger
   
- Bigger font zize e.g. for building preview overlay (for bigger screens very helpful)
   - As i mentioned in "R-E-D for OldWorld" scaling for resources is glitching out and therefore not recommneded unless you want weird glitchy looking resource sprites.
